# Project 3: Wave of Change Festival

*Academic Project*

### Nikita Sehgal

## Project Overview

The "Wave of Change" festival embodies a collective endeavor to champion ocean conservation and ecological stewardship. Partnering with Sea Shepherd, the festival unfolds over three days in the coastal haven of Santa Cruz, where attendees immerse themselves in a spectrum of activities designed to foster awareness, inspire action, and cultivate community.

From immersive beach cleanups to enlightening workshops with experts, and thought-provoking film screenings to live performances by artists dedicated to the cause, the festival offers a multifaceted platform for individuals to connect, learn, and contribute to the protection of our marine ecosystems.

With a seamless blend of functionality and aesthetics, our platform aims to amplify the festival's mission, empowering individuals to become advocates for marine conservation while fostering a sense of connection and community among participants. As a dynamic hub for information, collaboration, and action, the Wave of Change festival platform serves as a digital catalyst for positive change, igniting a ripple effect of environmental consciousness and collective action worldwide.
